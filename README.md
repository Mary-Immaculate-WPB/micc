## 📋 Project Background

### Recovery & Restoration Mission

This website was born from a digital crisis. When the original parish website was deleted and access revoked, a complete recovery operation was necessary:

**Recovery Process:**
- Recovered deleted website by scraping archived content from Wayback Machine
- Rebuilt site architecture, established new domain, and configured email infrastructure after access termination
- Salvaged critical business information from web archives to prevent total data loss

**New Infrastructure:**
- Registered new domain: `miwpb.online`
- Configured professional email boxes for parish communications
- Modernized design and improved accessibility
- Established version control and backup systems
- Created sustainable, long-term maintenance solution
